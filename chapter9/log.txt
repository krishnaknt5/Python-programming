Every morning at the break of dawn, Pt. tiptoed through the sleepy lanes
of Windfall Village, gathering whispers and secret wishes left behind by 
the dreamers of the night. Though nobody knew Pt.’s full name, everyone 
sensed a peculiar magic tied to that two-letter enigma. Children left tiny 
notes under their pillows, hoping Pt. would carry them safely to the realm 
of possibilities. Old Mrs. Marlow, sitting by her window, swore Pt. once 
rearranged her garden gnomes into a smiling parade while she slept. The baker 
claimed Pt. sprinkled his dough with a pinch of stardust, giving the first loaf 
of the day a warmth beyond mere bread. Each evening, as the sun dipped low, Pt. 
vanished into the soft glow of twilight—leavingbehind only a faint trace of laughter
 and untold wonder in every corner of the village.
