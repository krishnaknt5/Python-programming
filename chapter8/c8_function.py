#chapter 8: Functions
#The following code defines a function that calculates the average of two numbers using function
def avg():  #this part is called function definition
    a=int(input("Enter first number: "))
    b=int(input("Enter second number: "))
    avrg=(a+b)/2
    print(avrg)
avg() #this part is called function call
avg()
avg()
avg()



# The function avg() is called four times to calculate the average of two numbers each time (4 times). 
# Each time, it prompts the user to input two numbers and then calculates and prints their average.
# The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
#if i use 20 times, it will prompt the user to input two numbers 20 times and calculate the average each time.
# If you want to use the function multiple times, you can call it as many times as needed.
