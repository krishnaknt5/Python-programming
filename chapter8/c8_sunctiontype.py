'''This is not a program this is about types of functions in Python.
There are two types of functions in Python:
1. Built-in functions: These are functions that are already defined in Python, such as print(), len(), and type().
2. User-defined functions: These are functions that you define yourself using the def keyword.
3. Lambda functions: These are small anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword.
